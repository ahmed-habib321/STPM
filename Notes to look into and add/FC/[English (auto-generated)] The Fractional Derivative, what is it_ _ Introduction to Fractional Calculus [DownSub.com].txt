when learning calculus you are probably

accustomed to the idea of higher order

derivatives the first derivative

indicates the slope of a graph the

second derivative indicates concavity

and so on calculating the nth derivative

of a function is taking the derivative

at the function n times and this made

sense but what does it mean to take a

fractional derivative today we're going

to be exploring another branch of

calculus fractional calculus this

expression can have multiple meanings

first it can be thought of as a repeated

differentiation so if we take the nth

derivative of a function it means taking

the derivative n times however this only

makes sense for positive integers if we

are to extend this to other numbers we

must think of this expression as a

transformation something that takes in a

function as an input and gives a

function as an output and not repeated

differentiation now we look at D to the

N F by DX to the N as an operator that

transforms F into its nth derivative

let's establish a bit of notation when I

put I next to a function I mean the

indefinite integral of the function from

0 to X as we talked about earlier we can

think of this as a transformation

something that takes in a function and

outputs a function similar to

differentiation we put an exponent like

thing to denote the nth integral of F so

for example the third and integral would

look something like this

as we increase the number the expression

gets more and more complicated and

complex analysis legend Augustin Louis

oh she found a way to look at repeated

and the girls like this in a much

simpler way he proved the following

formula I to the N f of X is equal to 1

over n minus 1 factorial times the

integral from a to X of excellent minus

T to the N minus 1 F of T DT let's see

if we can prove this for n is equal to

plugging in the formula we get the

second integral of F is equal to the

integral from 0 to X of X minus T times

f of T DT for simplicity I'm going to

assign G of X to the second integral of

F so our goal now is to show that G of X

is equal to I squared f of X using

properties of integrals we can split

this into two integrals

now let's differentiate both sides the

first term requires the use of the

product rule and we can also use the

first fundamental theorem of calculus

evaluating all this it's equal to the

first integral of F since G of 0 is

equal is 0 G of X is equal to G of X

minus G of 0 which is simply the

integral from 0 to X of G prime of X by

the second fundamental theorem of

calculus this is equal to the second

integral of f of X so we have proved G

of X is equal to I squared f of X and so

the formula works for n is equal to 2 a

proof for all positive integers and can

be accomplished by using the binomial

theorem but that's a challenge I'm going

to leave for you to do for now let's

assume this formula works for all

positive integers and now the real

question is how do we define this

function for any positive number the

answer lies within the gamma function

the gamma function which looks like this

is equal to n minus 1 factorial for all

positive n the gamma function is an

extremely important function that

appears oliver math and deserves a whole

video if you want the video on the gamma

function let me know in the comments it

gives us a way to extend the familiar

domain of factorials from positive

integers the positive real and even

complex numbers basically the goal of

the gamma function was to define a

smooth curve that would go through

factorial points here I've plotted three

points which all satisfy f of X is equal

to n minus 1 factorial so for X minus 1

the y-coordinate is 1 minus 1 factorial

which is 1 similarly for X is equal to 2

the y-coordinate is 2 minus 1 factorial

which is equal to 1 and finally for X is

equal to 3 the y-coordinate is 3 minus 1

factorial which is equal to 2 the gamma

function is defined as follows it's the

integral from 0 to infinity of e to the

negative T times T to the power of Z

minus 1 here's a challenge for you try

to see why this equals n minus 1 for

positive integers hint it has to do with

integration by parts

since the main thing restricting the

domain of a formula for repeated

integration is the factorial we can

replace this with the gamma function

recall gamma of X is equal to X minus 1

factorial so it still works for positive

integers as it should but now we can

plug in any positive number for N and

get a value for this integral fractional

integrals sound absurd but this is a

valid operator this particular operator

is called the Riemann Lousiville

integral or RL integral for short

although there are many other ways of

going about fractional integration the

RL integral is probably the easiest to

understand we can also plug in complex

numbers in the end for refn greater than

zero there are few important relations

to understand with RL integration the

first is that I to the a times I to the

B of f of X is equal to I to the A plus

B of f of X and the second one is that

the derivative of I to the A plus 1 is

simply I to the a notice how we are

still preserving the first fundamental

theorem of calculus by the second

Formula one might assume that fractional

differentiation can be accomplished by

assuming that D to the N f of X by D X

to the N is equal to I to the negative n

over F but this doesn't really work

because the gamma function is not

defined for numbers with real components

less than zero we're gonna have to be a

bit more creative let's remember that

for all positive integers n we

understand that the nth derivative of

the nth integral is the function itself

so as we define fractional derivatives

for any positive number we must follow

this property to one other thing that

we'd like is to write this in terms of

functions we understand we understand

positive integer derivatives and

positive number integrals so a

fractional differentiation operator that

follows this property written in terms

of operators we understand can look like

this

D to the N F is equal to D to the seal

of n divided by D X to the Selah fan of

I to the seal of n minus n of F that was

a mouthful the operator seal is the

sealing function which basically rounds

up any decimal for example seal of four

point one is five seal of four point six

is five and seal of four is four now

using the Cauchy formula for repeated

integration we can write a formula for

the fractional derivative in terms of

regular positive integer differentiation

and fractional integration this is the

left Riemann Louisville fractional

derivative looking at this monstrosity

it's pretty clear why there hasn't been

any significant applications of

fractional differentiation in the past

300 years computing these without a

computer is pretty tedious and difficult

when n is equal to 0.5 we call this a

semi derivative combining fractional

differentiation and fractional

integration we can define an operator

called a differ integral by the

following piecewise definition

let's look at a nice animation that

demos are different ago operator let's

start with the function f of X is equal

to X the first derivative is f of X is

equal to 1 and the first integral is f

of X is equal 1/2 x squared now let's

see how the function varies applying our

differ integral operator from n is equal

to negative 1 to 1

[Music]

one thing to note is that familiar

properties like the chain rule and the

product rule don't really work as well

anymore

well this is to be expected and they can

exist in much more complicated forms

there is one property that makes

fractional derivatives useful normally

when we take first or second derivatives

the output of the derivative only

depends on the input we give it this is

called locality if we go back to the

definition of a fractional derivative we

have this little constant a at the

bottom of the integral

thus the fractional derivative has

nonlocality which means it doesn't only

depend on an input this is useful in

analyzing functions that only don't

depend on time for example some

phenomenon in the real world have

something called a memory effect which

means that the current state not only

depends on time but also in previous

States traditional differential

equations have a hard time modeling

phenomenon like this but fractional

derivatives can make the task easier

let's look at a few examples of

fractional derv lives the fractional

derivative for x to the n for n is

greater than zero which is our power

rule is given by D to the a X to the N

is gamma of n plus 1 divided by gamma of

n plus 1 minus a times X to the n minus

a a special case of this is the semi

derivative of f of X is equal to 1 d to

the 1/2 of 1 is 1 over the square root

of pi times X and for f of X is equal to

sine X we have d to DA sine of X is sine

of X plus a PI over 2 for the

exponential function the fractional

derivative is given by D to the a e to

the K X is K to the a times e to the X K

[Music]

let's look at one application of

fractional derivatives the tata crown

problem the tata crown problem looks for

a curve that does not depend on the

initial height for the time it takes to

reach the bottom of the curve what that

means is let's say we let an object go

from any point on the curve and the only

pulling force is gravity it will always

take a certain time to reach the bottom

of the curve you can see that by the

animation here Neil's able the one known

to solve this problem came up with the

following equation to calculate the time

taken to reach the end of the curve

where Y of 0 is the initial height here

s is the curve parametrized able solved

this problem using convolutions and

Laplace transforms

but using fractional calculus we can see

a much quicker solution if we divide

both sides by gamma of 1/2 which is

equal to the square of pi and move the

constant to the other side we get this

now if you notice something is that this

is in fact a semi integral so our

equation just ends up being the square

root of 2 G over PI T of 0 is equal to I

did a 1/2 of D s by D Y now to calculate

D s by D Y we simply take the semi

derivative of both sides and we get the

following equation for the s by dy and

in fact this differential equation

describes a curve which is called a

cycloid and the cycloid is a curve you

get when you roll a circle and focus on

a point this curve is also the solution

to the brookie Stallone problem which

tries to solve for a curve that takes

the fastest path from one point to the

other only pulled by gravity this topic

is really interesting and I've left the

few videos in the description if you are

curious the idea of fractional calculus

although it doesn't have that many

application does it demo an extremely

important lesson in math and that's to

try to break the rules and see what

happens

this is what led to the discovery of so

many things in that like complex numbers

when people tried to take the square

root of negative numbers and although

it's hard to see fractional derivatives

geometrically it's quite a fascinating

topic thank you for watching
